# selectomatic
latest is at https://github.com/njamescouk/selectomatic/tree/master/source/tcl
but UI not nice

very rough cut of interactive db reporting tool

just spent a few days getting to grips with tcl/tk.

tcl currently generates html, will move UI to tcl 
then display table of results in tcl with option to write
html.
